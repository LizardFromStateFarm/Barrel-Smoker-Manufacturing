# Barrel-Smoker-Manufacturing
This was a project where we benchmarked the smoker market.
Designed a custom smoker based on our desired feactures from the bench marking.
Created a gantt chart and bom to ensure a structure procces.
Developed and implemented a manufacturing process.
completed 11 barrel smokers before the deadline.


The pdf in this repository is a much more in depth report on the steps we used to create the barrels as well as featuring our mockups, gantt chart, bom, ect.
